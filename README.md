Boilerplate taken from https://github.com/gdi2290/angular-starter.git
To start project => npm start
To run unit tests => npm tests

Comments:
1) Taken from boilerplate, which leads to bunch of unused code
2) Tests run is taken from boilerplate, not the best solution, I'd prefer jasmine ran in node.js
3) Test are written just to cover task needs
4) Structure with inner routing selected just as an example
5) Lazy module left just for example
6) Styling is dummy, left as in boilerplate
7) MAIN: As task is artificial I don't know NFRs (performance, extensibility, reusability, etc.).
         So Architecture design was selected as "routing-based" as simple and straight.
         Simplicity of task has no need in any extra state management pattern.
